# Zense-Project

To open the code, uncompress it, click on project1, go to assets, click on scripts and you can find the different codes on different situations or scenes with the file ending with *.cs files. There is nothing like running a particular code. This set of codes are on different scenes linked with each other on order of game run. You can click on *.unity files in assets. To run the game go to this github website https://github.com/tarunrayavaram/game.git and uncompress it and click on CUBE SLICE.exe. Since it is a large file, I need to compress and divide the files sorry for the inconvinence caused if any.
